# Text-classification-Logistic-Regressions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **text classification model** using **Logistic Regression**. The goal is to classify text data into predefined categories using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Text classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project aims to:
- Preprocess raw text data
- Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate its performance using standard metrics

## 🧰 Technologies and Tools
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK   
- VS Code


## 📊 Dataset
- **Type**: Custom, private dataset
- **Description**: The dataset consists of text samples labeled into predefined categories.
- **Classes**: arts, crime etc 
- **Note**: Due to privacy or licensing restrictions, the dataset is not publicly shared. If you would like to experiment, you can adapt the code to use a similar publicly available dataset. 

## 🔄 Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Lowercasing
- Stopword removal
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF**

## 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF


## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: 85.0%
- Precision: 84.9%
- Recall: 85.0%
- F1 Score: 84.9%
